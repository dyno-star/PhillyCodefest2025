♻️ B.A.G.S. - The Future of Smarter Recycling 🚀

We all know recycling isn’t perfect, but trying to do the right thing shouldn’t make you feel like a waste of space! 🗑️ That’s where B.A.G.S. (Basic Artificial Garbage Sorter) 🛍️🤖 comes in.

Plastic bags are one of the biggest culprits in contaminating recycling bins, making entire loads of recyclable materials unusable. ❌ B.A.G.S. uses cutting-edge AI to detect plastic bags before they end up where they don’t belong. ✅

🛠️ How It Works

Our system is powered by OpenCV 📷 for image processing and YOLO (You Only Look Once) 🦾 for object detection. The backend is built in Python 🐍, and we’ve custom-trained a model to recognize different types of plastic bags with an impressive 70-90% confidence rate! 🎯

With more time and refinement, we can improve accuracy and expand detection capabilities to other non-recyclables like bubble wrap 🫧, plastic straws 🥤, and more.
